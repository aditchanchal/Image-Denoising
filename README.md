# Image-Denoising
Image Denoising model based on Deep CNN in Keras.

# Abstract
Image denoising has been recently attracting considerable attentions due to its applications in various fields. In our project, we construct a feed-forward denoising Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to embrace the progress in very deep architecture, learning algorithm and regularization method into image denoising .

Here we incorporate following approaches:
* CNN
* Residual Learning
* Batch Normalization

# Results
* PSNR(dB) = 29.33
* SSIM (%) = 91.5
